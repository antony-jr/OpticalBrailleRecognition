# Optical Braille Recognition

**Optical braille recognition** is the act of capturing and processing images of braille characters into natural language characters. It is used to convert braille documents for people who cannot read them into text, and for preservation and reproduction of the documents. 

The recognition uses simple computational geometry to do the segmentation and classification.
Optionally you can use the segmenting engine and use your own classifier, a artificial neural network might be a good choice.

But it is worth to note that the segmenting engine only works with single sided English braille.

*Documentation is not given because I think no one will need this, atleast for now.
